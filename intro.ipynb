    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud data security is a critical challenge in today’s digital age. Traditional encryption methods face increasing threats, especially with the advent of quantum computing. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed integrating **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** with advanced encryption schemes such as **Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE)**. The paper under discussion introduces a model that leverages multi-qubit QKD to generate secure keys and then uses CP-ABE to enforce fine-grained access control over encrypted cloud data. This approach is designed to ensure that even if a cloud system is compromised, only users with the correct attributes (e.g., \"Manager\" and \"Finance\") can decrypt the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper's Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper outlines a multi-step process:\n",
    "- **QKD for Key Generation:**\n",
    "  - **Multi-Qubit Generation:**  \n",
    "    Alice prepares entangled qubit pairs with chaotic behavior to introduce true randomness.\n",
    "  - **Transmission and Measurement:**  \n",
    "    The qubits are sent to Bob, who measures them. Following this, error correction and privacy amplification yield a secure secret key.\n",
    "- **CP-ABE for Access Control:**  \n",
    "  - The QKD-generated key is used to encrypt cloud data.\n",
    "  - CP-ABE enforces an access policy, ensuring that only users whose attributes meet the policy can decrypt the key (or the data).\n",
    "- **Secure Cloud Data Protection:**  \n",
    "  - The integration of QKD and CP-ABE provides robust security against both classical and quantum adversaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we have built a **proof-of-concept simulation** that captures the core ideas of the paper. Our implementation is divided into several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **QKD Simulation:**\n",
    "   - **Alice’s Role:**  \n",
    "     - Generates entangled Bell pairs using Qiskit.\n",
    "     - Applies chaotic rotations (using a logistic map) to simulate quantum randomness.\n",
    "   - **Bob’s Role:**  \n",
    "     - Measures the qubits using Qiskit’s **AerSimulator**.\n",
    "     - The measurement outcomes (classical bit strings) serve as the basis for key derivation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Key Derivation:**\n",
    "   - The measurement outcomes are concatenated and hashed with SHA‑256.\n",
    "   - The first 16 bytes (128 bits) of the hash are used as the AES key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetric Encryption with AES:**\n",
    "   - The derived AES key is used to encrypt a plaintext message in AES EAX mode.\n",
    "   - Decryption is performed to verify that the process correctly recovers the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CP-ABE Simulation:**\n",
    "   - A sample policy is defined requiring attributes `\"Manager\"` and `\"Finance\"`.\n",
    "   - The message is \"encrypted\" (conceptually) along with this policy.\n",
    "   - Decryption is allowed only if the user's attributes satisfy the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud Integration (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "While our simulation currently focuses on local cryptographic operations, the model can be integrated with cloud systems as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Encryption:**  \n",
    "  Data is encrypted locally using the AES key derived from the QKD process, then uploaded to a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Key Management and Access Control:**  \n",
    "  The QKD key (protected by CP-ABE) ensures that only authorized users can decrypt the AES key and, subsequently, the cloud data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Communication:**  \n",
    "  Secure channels (e.g., TLS) ensure that both data and key distribution remain confidential during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates a simplified workflow:\n",
    "- **Simulated QKD Key Generation:**  \n",
    "  Through entangled qubit pairs with chaotic rotations.\n",
    "- **AES Encryption:**  \n",
    "  Using a key derived from quantum measurements.\n",
    "- **CP-ABE Simulation:**  \n",
    "  Enforcing attribute-based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though simplified, this proof-of-concept captures the core ideas of integrating QKD with CP-ABE for cloud data security. It provides a foundation for further development towards a fully robust cryptographic system.\n",
